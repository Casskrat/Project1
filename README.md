# Project1
Project Description:
Analysis of what affects car accidents and how this could possibly improve road safety. Based on the data we will decide which junction is the safest to use, which speed limits are the safest for drivers and the type of road based on geographic location that should be  used to make sure there are not as many accidents.
Research Questions:
1.What junction incurs the least amount of accidents?
2.Is the accident severity affected by the speed?
3.Does geographic location with road type in mind have an affect on the number of accidents that occur?

Used Road_accident_data_csv and Geoapify.

Located in the data folder is the Road_accident_data_csv which is the dataset used for this project. Located in the Code folder is two files with different code created for our analysis. Located in the Analysis Folder are two documents, the first is the Summary of our conclusions from the analysis and the sencond is the presentation created.
