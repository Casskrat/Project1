# Project1
Project Description:
Analysis of what affects car accidents and how this could possibly improve road safety. Based on the data we will decide which junction is the safest to use, which speed limits are the safest for drivers and the type of road based on geographic location that should be  used to make sure there are not as many accidents.

Research Questions:
1.What junction incurs the least amount of accidents?
2.Is the accident severity affected by the speed?
3.Does geographic location with road type in mind have an affect on the number of accidents that occur?

Used Road_accident_data_csv and Geoapify.

Conclusion:

T-intersections is one of the leading causes for increased number of car accidents.T-Intersection vs. Roundabout. Urban area prone to more accidents overall than rural. Single carriageway most common accident in urban areas. Majority of the casualties that occur due to car accidents are in urban areas rather than rural areas. It seems the only way we can mitigate the number of car crashes for the speed limit is to turn Single carriageways into dual carriageways. We would be able to decrease the number of car crashes by 1,300 for 30 MPH zones and 1,270 for 60 MPH zones.
